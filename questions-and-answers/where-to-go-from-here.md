Where to go from here
=====================

Weekly log

Individual
---------------------

* Install lab environment
* Ensure I can setup a git repo and connect to GitHub
* Setup my own personal python development project
* Read the A02
* Done on Tuesday.


Team
---------------------


### A healthy team

Until Next Monday

* Meeting Wednesday/Thursday
* Make a health check, ask all members if they feel okey and are onboard and ready. What can each one bring to the table?
* Sketch the class design like UML
* Create the working directory and its structure, a git manager could be nice
* Make a main.py and lint it (make lint aka running pylint and flake8).
* Make a rough dividing of the work (you can change this as the project goes on)

Try to have some code written already by early next week.

Next Monday is unit testing day.

* Git/GitHub
* Put python modules into sub directories
    * Show a sample of it (guess with subdirs into its own repo / video)
