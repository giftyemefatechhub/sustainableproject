Week 05 - Part 2 Testing
---------------------

"Lecture 05 - Introduction to the module" is an introduction to the remaining parts of the course and focus on getting started with the development environment and the Assignment 02 project.



### Things to do on your own

To be on top of things you should individually do these exercises that are part of Lecture 05.

* Install the lab environment.
* Try out the example programs in the example repo.
* Ensure you can setup a git repo and connect to GitHub.
* Setup your own personal Python development project using a venv.
    * A [project template](https://gitlab.com/mikael-roos/python-template) is available to make this easier.
* Read the A02 to learn what your team should do in the project.

You should try to do this before you meet with the team. That is the way to prepare yourself and becoming an active team member.



### A healthy team

You now have one week to get your team up to speed with the A02.

* Have a first meeting.
    * Make a health check, ask all members if they feel okey and are onboard and ready.
    * What can each one bring to the table?
* Walkthrouth the A02, prioritize if needed and decide on the project focus.
* Do a rough sketch on the class design (UML).
* Roughly try to divide the work (you do that class and you do that class), you can change this as the project goes on.
* Appoint a Git manager or someone who will be responsible to integrate all the members code into a working version.
* Create the working directory and its structure, put it onto GitHub (or GitLab) so everybody has the same setup and easy access to linters and testtools.
    * A [project template](https://gitlab.com/mikael-roos/python-template) is available to make this easier.
* Make a main.py and you are on your way. Integrate your code at least once a week to avoid integration problems.

Try to have some code written already by early next week. If you have that - then it will be a great start for unittesting.



Week 06 - Lets do some unittesting
---------------------

During this week you shall review the prerecored lectures that also have reading instructions.

* Lecture 6 - Introduction to Software Testing
* Lecture 7 - Software Unit Testing

The session in class will focus on the exercise "Exercise 2 - Software Unit Testing" that will learn you the basics of unittesting and code coverage in Python.



Week 07 - TDD and Documentation
---------------------

During this week you shall review the prerecored lectures that also have reading instructions.

* Lecture 8 - Test-driven development
* Lecture 9 - Software Documentation

The session in class will focus on the following exercises:

* Exercise 3 - Test Driven Development
* Exercise 4 - Software Documentation



Week 08 - Part 3 Sustainable programming and Clean code
---------------------

"Lecture 10 - Introduction to the module" is an introduction to what will happen.

The Assignment 3 "Sustainable programming through good and clean code" will be presented together with guidelines on how to structure the report.

The session in class will focus on the following exercises:

* Exercise 5 - Static code analysis and metrics

During this week you shall review the prerecored lectures that also have reading instructions.

* Lecture 11 - What about good and clean code?

Deadline to submit A02.



Week 09 - Opposion and Report week
---------------------

Begin the opposition part of A02.

During this week you shall review the prerecored lectures that also have reading instructions.

* Lecture 12 - Software development philosophies
* Lecture 13 - Static code analysing and metrics

Write on your report.



Week 10 - Submission week
---------------------

Submit the opposition report on A02.

Submit the report on A03.
