Lab environment
========================

This is the essential lab environment you need to have before starting to work with the exercises in this repo. Ensure that you have it all installed on your computer.

There are a lot of alternate development environments that likely will work for you. But to make everything as smooth as possible it is expected that you use a development environment that includes the following.

* Git
* Python 3
* Terminal (bash or zsh)
* Make



Computer and operating system
------------------------

You need a computer with an operating system like **Windows, MacOS or Linux**. Use the latest version to avoid troubles. Ensure that you are up to date.



Git
------------------------

Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and learn how to use it through the terminal.

You can check your current version like this in your terminal.

```
$ git --version
git version 2.20.1
```

If you need assistance there is a video here.

The terminal
------------------------

Get acquainted with your **terminal** and learn how to use it and navigate through it.

* Windows - git bash (cygwin and WSL are alternatives)
* MacOS - terminal (bash or zsh)
* Linux - any terminal application (prefer bash but others might work)

If you need assistance there is a video here.

**NOTE** You could also setup a development environment using the Windows terminals cmd and powershell. However, they have different syntax than a bash terminal and to make the it easy and straightforward it is expected that you are working with a bash terminal.



Python
------------------------

Check you version of Python or download and install the [latest version of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You can check your current version like this. The `$` sign is the prompt and is not part of the command to write.

```
$ python3 --version
Python 3.7.3
```






GitLab or GitHub
------------------------

You may add your project to a private instance of GitLab or GitHub or equal Git web service.

You should learn to use these services as they or similar will most likely be part of your everyday work environment.



Make and Makefiles
------------------------

_This is an optional install and you can live without it._

If you have not yet heard about Makefiles, please read the short [introduction to Makefiles](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Introduction.html).

Makefiles are in general used to compile, build and run programs and tasks.

You can check your current version like this.

```
$ make --version
GNU Make 4.2.1
```

If you are a Windows user you might want to check out this post about how to [install make on Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/a/32127632). The Windows package manager `chocolatey` might be the way to go, if you are on a Windows terminal.


<!--
Node and npm
------------------------

You need to install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) which provides an environment to run JavaScript from your terminal. This will include the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). These will be used as development tools.
-->


<!--
Web browser
------------------------

Get a **web browser**, or three. It is useful to test out your website in different browsers since there are differences among them. Take the browser that is available on your computer and complement with [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). Try to make your code work in all browsers.
-->



Texteditor/IDE
------------------------

Install a texteditor or IDE of your choice. [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and both good choices as a plain texteditor with plugin capabilities. Ensure you are using the following setup through out the course:

* File format UTF-8 NOBOM
* Unix style line endings LF `\n`
* Soft tabs, length 4



Where to go from here?
------------------------

Here are a few things you could do to learn a bit about your development environment.



### Learn more on Git

If you are new to Git, you might want to work through the document "[Work with Git](work-with-git)" to gain some basic knowledge on how to work with Git and Git repos.

There is a video playlist showing you how to work with the initial steps in Git.

* [Git, GitHub and GitLab - Learn and practice](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEtyhUSKTK3iTFcdLANJq0TkKo246XAlv)



### Clone a repo

Clone a repo and see how it looks. You can clone this repo by entering the following into the terminal.

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/mikael-roos/oopython.git
```

You can visit the [same repo online](https://gitlab.com/mikael-roos/oopython).
