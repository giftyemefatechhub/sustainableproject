Precondition
---------------------

You should have knowledge on Git and GitHub and you should have Git with GitBash installed on your environment.

You should have knowledge on how to write a object oriented program with Python using classes.



Overview of part 2 & part 3
---------------------

"Part 2: Testing" is about testing and documentation of the code.

* Work in teams of two and two and develop an application using object oriented Python.
    * Apply linters to enhance the code.
    * Use unit testing.
* Oppose on other projects by reviewing them.

"Part 3: Clean Code" is about the concept of what makes clean and good code.

* Write a report and summarize your view of the topic and your learnings from the project work and the opposition.



Prepare
---------------------

Prepare yourself through the following.

1. [Work with Git](https://gitlab.com/mikael-roos/oopython/-/blob/main/public/doc/work-with-git.md). Review this article that provides an overview of Git commands and practice the commands on the terminal Git Bash. The article includes a [video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEtyhUSKTK3iTFcdLANJq0TkKo246XAlv) that shows the basics.

Using Git is optional in the assignment, but it is also highly recommended as a learning experience.



Week 05 - Part 2 Testing
---------------------

Start with an overall introduction, get going with the lab environment and the assignment.

**Teacher activities**

* Slides on "[Introduction to testing and clean code](https://gitlab.com/mikael-roos/oopython/-/blob/main/public/lecture/intro-testing-clean-code/README.md)" as an overall introduction to the concepts.

*_About object oriented programming with Python. Hmmm, is this already fixed? Perhaps an OO example using slides?_


**Lab environment & Exercises**

* Ensure that you have [all tools in your lab environment](https://gitlab.com/mikael-roos/oopython/-/blob/main/public/doc/lab-environment.md).
* Learn how to "[Work in a Python virtual environment](https://gitlab.com/mikael-roos/oopython/-/blob/main/public/doc/python-venv.md)".
* When you have installed all parts of the development environment, then you can try all tools out in the article/exercise "[Work with an example Python development repo](https://gitlab.com/mikael-roos/oopython/-/blob/main/public/doc/work-with-a-example-python-development-repo.md)".

**Assignment**

* Start of A02 and a walkthough of the requirements.
    * There is a [template you can use for the project](https://gitlab.com/mikael-roos/python-template).

**Work**

* Establish the project team and start working by reading through the guidelines in "[Hints for a healthy team](../../public/doc/hints-for-a-healthy-team.md)".



Week 06 - Unit testing
---------------------

How to add unit tests to your project.

**Teacher activities**

* Slides on "[Python Uunit tests and code coverage](https://gitlab.com/mikael-roos/oopython/-/blob/main/public/lecture/unittesting-in-python/README.md)" as an overall introduction to the concepts.

* A walkthrough of the exercise "[Unit testing and code coverage in Python](https://gitlab.com/mikael-roos/oopython/-/blob/main/public/doc/unit-testing-and-code-coverage-in-python.md)" that will learn you the basics of unit testing and code coverage in Python.

* A discussion on [how to become a healthy team (part 2)](../../public/doc/hints-for-a-healthy-team-part-2.md).

**Lectures**

During this week you shall review the pre recorded lectures that also have reading instructions.

* Lecture 6 - Introduction to Software Testing
* Lecture 7 - Software Unit Testing

**Work**

* Add unit testing to A02 (amongst other things).



Week 07 - TDD and Documentation
---------------------

Final week of part 2, discuss TDD and generate documentation.

**Teacher activities**

The session in class will focus on discussing and solving the following exercises:

* [Test Driven Development](../../public/doc/test-driven-development.md)
* [Software Documentation](../../public/doc/generate-python-documentation.md)

**Lectures**

During this week you shall review the pre recorded lectures that also have reading instructions.

* Lecture 8 - Test-driven development
* Lecture 9 - Software Documentation

**Work**

* Generate documentation for you A02.
* Prepare to submit A02 next week.



Week 08 - Part 3 Clean code
---------------------

Lets review the concept of good and clean code.

**Teacher activities**

* The lecture "[Clean code, metrics and philosophies with Python](../../public/lecture/clean-code-metrics/README.md)" is an introduction to this part of the course.
* The Assignment 3 "Sustainable programming through good and clean code" will be presented together with guidelines on how to structure the report.

The session in class will focus on the following exercises:

* [Static code analysis and metrics](../../public/doc/static-code-analysis-and-metrics.md)

**Lectures**

During this week you shall review the pre recored lectures that also have reading instructions.

* Lecture 11 - Static code analysing and metrics

**Work**

* Run metrics on your A02 code, anything to fix before submission?
* Deadline to submit A02.
* Start working on report for A03.



Week 09 - Opposion and Report week
---------------------

Work with the report and the opposition.

**Teacher activities**

* Start the opposition part of A02.
* Classroom session with analysing metrics.
* Helpsession with the writing of the report.

**Lectures**

During this week you shall review the prerecored lectures that also have reading instructions.

* Lecture 12 - What about good and clean code?
* Lecture 13 - Software development philosophies

**Work**

* Begin the opposition part of A02.
* Write on your report A03.



Week 10 - Submission week
---------------------

**Teacher activities**

* Supervision and helpsession with the writing of the report.

**Submit your work**

* Submit the opposition report on A02.
* Submit the report on A03.
